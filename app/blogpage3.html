<p>Other than the obvious fact that they produce oxygen, plants are very vital in our lives. In fact, one of the easiest ways to reduce pollution on a personal level is to grow a plant, as they help purify the air around you. 
       </p>

       <p style="font-size:20px">
         

       
       </p>
<p>
    To start simply, they exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide, filtering the air around them. They provide nourishment for the entire food chain.  This is the beautiful thing about humans and plants, we equally take and give each other the most vital thing needed to survive. It's almost like nature providing a natural balance. Even indoors, plants can act as heating and cooling systems, help filter out gasses, and freshen the air. Plants like English ivy, aloe vera, reed palm, etc. 
   </p>
  <p style="font-size:20px">
   <b>Furthermore...</b> 
       
   </p>

<p>
  
        Plants also play an important role in the water cycle, making sure there is a continuous movement of water. They produce water vapor from their leaves, which then transpired into the atmosphere to form rain clouds. In addition, plants are considered carbon sinks. Which is the main product of fossil fuels and increases the greenhouse effect. Aka, the reasons for climate change. Plants can store carbon and even use it in photosynthesis.


       
  
       <p> Putting aside humans, plants are a source of habitat for animals. They make up our ecosystem. They provide shelter and food.  Unfortunately, like everything else mentioned here, even this is threatened due to climate change, deforestation, or desertification. 

  
       </p>
       <p>
The most important thing to remember is that you don't have to go plant trees, campaign for no deforestation, to make a change. Every action matters, even growing that little money plant in your living room. It might seem like it's not helping much in this long battle against climate change, but it's a start, which is, unfortunately, something not many people do either.

  <p >So go to your nearest home depo or nursery, by a plant. Maybe an Arcea Plam, they filter out harsh chemical, or a Rubber Plant, to absorb carbon dioxide or a Peace Lilly, it has a 60% success rate or even just some good old aloe vera.  Let's help save the world.
