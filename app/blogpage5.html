       <p>One of our main goals has always been to help combat the effects of deforestation.
We’ve centered our organization around this goal, and used the resources we have to fund the replanting of trees in places that are highly affected. Places like rainforests and the tropics.

</p>
  
       <p>
         Deforestation is largely a problem caused by humans. Even forest fires can be attributed to the increase in temperatures due to climate change. It does come full circle. 
</p>
  <b>But why is this such a big problem? </b>
       <p>

Even though trees can grow by themselves, the consequences are so bad that we need to give it a kick start.  Like I mentioned before, it can cause climate change, desertification, worse things like soil erosion, decrease in crops, flooding, and an increase in greenhouse gases. There's a loss of habitat. 70 % of land animals and plant species live in forests. In addition, it can result in drastic temperature variation, which is highly dangerous for the organisms.  To expand, we would lose valuable carbon sinks and an important means of regulating the water cycle. Resulting in dryer soil and less chance for growth.  Leading to more issues, as trees help retain water and topsoil, which helps price the nutrients to help grow more trees. 
</p>
  
       <p>The Amazon, the Atlantic Forest, Borneo, Cerrado, Choco-Darien, Eastern Australia, are just the tip of all the forests in danger as of now.  </p>
  
       <p>Through our  20 year journey of helping eliminate climate change, we've made it a point to visit all these places mentioned above and fund the local and international campaigns to plant trees. From providing the tools to classes on what tree would be the right fit, we’ve continuously made an effort. 
</p>

       
       
       <p style="font-size:20px">
        <b> What We Do.</b></p>
       
       <p>
      We started from a small group of people to millions of active volunteers all around the world. Last year was our highest success yet, planting over 12 Million trees all over the world. We also set our highest record yet in the number of people who joined our program. With an astounding number of 3 million people around the world stepping up to help our cause. As this program grows, we predict even greater results in the coming years.  
       </p>
<p>
  So even if traveling places to plant trees isn't something you see yourself doing, support us in our journey by donating and spreading awareness of our cause and actions.  It's a success even if we plant one tree at a time.
